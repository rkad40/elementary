<h3>Leader Board</h3>
The leader board shows teams ranked top to bottom based on adjusted, par-relative score.
The adjusted team score is a team's raw score  minus the <i>prorated</i> handicap.  For example, say a team's handicap is +7.  This team would get one stroke subtracted from their score on each of the seven <i>hardest</i> rated holes.  This means that the team will get a pro-rated stroke <i>only on select holes</i>.
<h3>Leader Board Deactivation</h3>
The leader board will be de-activated for the last six holes to be played.  
<h3>How is Adjusted Score Calculated?</h3>
The adjusted team score is calculated by taking the team's raw score and subtracting their <i>prorated handicap</i>. 
What is a pro-rated handicap?  
Say a team has a +7 handicap.  This team will get to subtract seven strokes from their <i>final</i> score.  So if they shoot even par for the round, they will finish seven under with their handicap. Simply enough.
But how do you apply handicaps in-flight, for a tournament that is still in progress?  Apply all of the handicap up front such that a team <i>starts seven under</i>?  Only apply all of the handicap at the end?  Both of those methods don't allow you to compare teams with different handicaps on the fly.  
That's where pro-rated handicapping comes in.  A pro-rated handicapping system dispenses handicap strokes in a metered fashion.   
Here's how it works ...
Our team from above, with +7 handicap, would get to subtract <i>one</i> stroke from each of the <i>seven most difficult holes</i>, as rated by the course.  Say, for example, our +7 handicapped team has played 5 holes and shot even par, that is, +0.  Also suppose that, of the five holes played, two are counted among the course's seven hardest.  This means our team will have received +2 of the +7 handicap strokes and their adjusted score will be -2 (i.e. 0 - 2 = -2).       
This is the recommended way to score in-flight tournaments with handicaps.  If you don't do pro-rated handicapping, the leader board that tracks scores real-time wouldn't make a lot of sense.
