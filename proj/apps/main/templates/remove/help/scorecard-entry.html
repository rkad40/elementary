<h3>Entering Your Score</h3>
To enter a score, click <strong>Input Score</strong> and select your score, in strokes, for the current hole.  Options are available to enter your raw score, or your par relative score.  When done, click <strong>Enter</strong>.
When you enter a score, the hole is automatically advanced to the next hole.  You can, however, navigate freely using the arrow buttons or the <strong>Go to Hole</strong> button.
<h3>Closest to the Hole and Longest Drive Holes</h3>
On closest to the hole and longest drive holes, an additional button will appear in the display.  It is bright red, and will say "Closest to the Hole" or "Longest Drive". You can't miss it.
If a team member has either the closest to the hole shot or longest drive ball, click the red button and select the player's name.  That's it.  No need to write it down on the marker.
If you scroll down on your electronic scorecard, you will see a <strong>Hole Awards</strong> section that lists current closest to the hole and longest drive winners.  
<h3>How is Adjusted Score Calculated?</h3>
The adjusted team score is calculated by taking the team's raw score and subtracting their <i>prorated handicap</i>. 
What is a pro-rated handicap?  
Say a team has a +7 handicap.  This team will get to subtract seven strokes from their <i>final</i> score.  So if they shoot even par for the round, they will finish seven under with their handicap. Simply enough.
But how do you apply handicaps in-flight, for a tournament that is still in progress?  Apply all of the handicap up front such that a team <i>starts seven under</i>?  Only apply all of the handicap at the end?  Both of those methods don't allow you to compare teams with different handicaps on the fly.  
That's where pro-rated handicapping comes in.  A pro-rated handicapping system dispenses handicap strokes in a metered fashion.   
Here's how it works ...
Our team from above, with +7 handicap, would get to subtract <i>one</i> stroke from each of the <i>seven most difficult holes</i>, as rated by the course.  Say, for example, our +7 handicapped team has played 5 holes and shot even par, that is, +0.  Also suppose that, of the five holes played, two are counted among the course's seven hardest.  This means our team will have received +2 of the +7 handicap strokes and their adjusted score will be -2 (i.e. 0 - 2 = -2).       
This is the recommended way to score in-flight tournaments with handicaps.  If you don't do pro-rated handicapping, the leader board that tracks scores real-time wouldn't make a lot of sense.
<h3>Your Team Information</h3>
Number of holes played, holes remaining, raw score (par relative), team handicap, and adjusted score (par relative) are shown.  There is also a progress bar tracking the holes you have completed, and the holes you have yet to play.
